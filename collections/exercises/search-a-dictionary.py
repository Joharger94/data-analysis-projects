## Set a variable called choice to the flavor you want to search for.

## Use an if statement to check if choice is in the flavors dictionary.

## If it is, set another variable called cost to the value associated with choice.

## If it isnâ€™t, set cost to 0.

## Print the cost.
choice = 'cookies and cream'
if choice in flavors: 
    cost = flavors[choice]
else: 
    cost = 0
print('The cost of', choice, 'is', cost)
### Search a Dictionary Part 2:

## Initialize two variables: highest_cost to 0 and fanciest to an empty string.

## Loop through the flavors dictionary using a for loop.

## For each flavor, check if its price is higher than highest_cost.

## If it is, update fanciest to this flavor and highest_cost to its price.

## After the loop, print the most expensive flavor.
highest_cost = 0 
fanciest = ''

for flavor in flavors:
    if flavors[flavor] > highest_cost:
        fanciest = flavor
        highest_cost = flavors[flavor]

print('The fanciest flavor is', fanciest, 'and it costs', highest_cost)
